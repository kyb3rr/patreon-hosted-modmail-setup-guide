## Thank you for subscribing to Patreon!

Welcome to Patreon hosting! Before we can start hosting your new Modmail bot, we will need some bot infos from youâ€”namely a Discord bot token, an external MongoDB database, and some other minor things. By the end of this guide, we will hopefully have generated everything we need for bot hosting.

If you already hosting an existing Modmail bot and would rather transfer that over, **click here** to find out how!

### Getting Started

#### What you'll need:
 - An internet connection and browser.
 - An email account.
 - ~15 minutes of your time.

**It's crucial to follow every step carefully! Missing any step might increase the final setup time.**

### Step 1 - Creating Discord Bot Account

You will need to create a bot application to interact with the Discord API. Head over to the [Applications Page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). Log in - if you're not already - and click on **New Application**. Give it any name and click **Confirm** to register your bot.

Here you can customize your bot profile with a profile picture and an "About Me" section. Afterwards, press on the **Bot** tab, click on **Add Bot**, then choose **Yes, do it!** to confirm.
