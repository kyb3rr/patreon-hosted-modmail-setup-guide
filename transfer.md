### Heroku

Navigate to [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the heroku.com website, login if prompted. Choose the Modmail Bot application (does <u>not</u> have the *zzz* logo).

The page will display all your Modmail configs. Copy every field and send it back to Patreon Modmail DM.<br>**Note: it must include the token, MongoDB connection string, and guild ID.**

If your bot is still running, navigate to the **Resources** tab, click on the pencil icon, turn off the worker switch, and press **confirm**. Otherwise, your bot may send duplicate messages.

Lastly, choose a memorable name for your Logviewer. You will be provided with a log URL under our **.modmail.dev** domain name. You can choose anything you like (with a few restrictions), if you feel it's reasonable, then most likely we do too! Note: only 3-16 alphanumeric characters are allowed. Send this to Patreon Modmail DM as well.


### Repl.it

Navigate to [My Repls](https://replit.com/repls){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the repl.it website, login if prompted. Choose the Modmail Bot repl (not the logviewer's).

![Open Modmail Repl](https://i.imgur.com/q6kOBJJ.png)

On the side panel, click on the lock icon (Secret environment variables). Scroll down to the bottom and click **Open raw editor**.

If your bot is still running, press on the **Stop** button at the top and disable any uptime robots you may have enabled to stop the current bot from running. Otherwise, your bot may send duplicate messages.

Lastly, choose a memorable name for your Logviewer. You will be provided with a log URL under our **.modmail.dev** domain name. You can choose anything you like (with a few restrictions), if you feel it's reasonable, then most likely we do too! Note: only 3-16 alphanumeric characters are allowed. Send this to Patreon Modmail DM as well.
