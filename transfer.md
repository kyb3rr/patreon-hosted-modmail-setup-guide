[Go Back](/)

You have chosen to transfer over your existing Modmail bot to Patreon hosting. See below for your current hosting method.


### Repl.it

Navigate to [My Repls](https://replit.com/repls){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the repl.it website, login if prompted. Choose the Modmail Bot repl (not the logviewer's).

You will be greeted with a popup text box containing your secrets, copy everything in there and send back it to Patreon Modmail DM.

If your bot is still running, press on the **Stop** button at the top and disable any uptime robots you may have enabled to stop the current bot from running. Otherwise, your bot may send duplicate messages.

Lastly, choose a memorable name for your Logviewer. You will be provided with a log URL under our **.modmail.dev** domain name. You can choose anything you like (with a few restrictions), if you feel it's reasonable, then most likely we do too! Note: only 3-16 alphanumeric characters are allowed. Send this to Patreon Modmail DM as well.
